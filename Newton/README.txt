Newton is a one-dimensional stepped physics simulation which can handle springs, gravity,
drag, friction, and handle collisions at a basic level.

It uses a riemann sum to approxamate the effects of the forces on a single particle, allowing
it to work in scenarios where differential equations would be necessary.

Newton is limited by the one-dimensional simulation, but it can still solve a number of 
complex problems.

- How long will it take two masses (one 165kg and one 125kg) 15m apart to collide? (about 6 days) (PhysicsMajors.py)
- Model the behavior of a spring-block system on a rough incline (SpringBlock.py)
- how high will an apple bounce if you drop it? (not very high) (AppleDrop.py)
- How long will an egg-drop device take to hit the ground, and what sort of G-forces will be endured? (3.1 seconds and about 3g) (EggDrop.py)
