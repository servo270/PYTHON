#Ramnell n-dimensional Physics engine

To update Newton, I began working with a friend to create an extremely
flexible physics engine. To that end, Ramnell requires as little basis
on the real world as possible, featuring:
- n-dimensional physics: Everything is defined in terms of vectors, so 
   you can do kinematics in five dimensions if you want
- user-defined forces: Any function can be used as a force, provided 
   that it returns a vector
- multiple systems in parallel: add objects to systems, can run multiple
   simulations at once

The system is extremly powerful and capable of modeling literally any
particle based system, provided you can generate the function to describe
the forces.

Examples:
- multiple projectiles acting under drag forces in three dimensions
- n-body orbital simulations
- spring equilibrium problems

Further development:
- collision detection is primitive, currently only functioning for spheres and planes
- plotting currently requires writing to a file and graphing externally, a dedicated
   visual interface is being developed
- conservation of momentum with collisions is not yet integrated
